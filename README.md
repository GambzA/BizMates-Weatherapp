This is Roi Mark Gamba and I would like to thank you again for considering my application!
I have uploaded the file on GITHUB as instructed.

Please make sure to follow the directory name which is: BizMates-Weatherapp
If you wish to have you own directory name and domain: Please modify config.php

Installation Guide:
1. Compatible Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, or Linux  
2. Please install or have the following Apache Local Server: XAMPP v3.3.0 or greater WITH PHP 8.0.0:   
   Downnload Link: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html  
  
   2.1. Please follow these guides on how to install and setup xampp:  
        2.1.1. https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/  
        2.1.2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6ENnaRotmo  

3. Once installation and setup is complete. Please make sure to have this directory name under htdocs folder: BizMates-Weatherapp  
    3.1. Please see following screenshot guides on how the file structure should look like:  
        Step 1: https://prnt.sc/NGdiVGQB-sQz  
        Step 2: https://prnt.sc/DasXmq-bjjLk  
        Step 3: https://prnt.sc/aDh56Dilf0Vr  

4. Once that is done. The weather app should be available by visiting http://localhost/BizMates-Weatherapp/  
  
  
  
The next section will orient the features of the system:
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The app has a simple and straightforward UI/UX design for easier navigation 
especially when a tourist would immediately like to check on a place and things that they can do and go to

A quick weather summary is also shown in each city. This make it easier for them to check the current weather on that area
Of course, smartphone users are the first ones that I had in mind while designing this; Due to it's simplicity with scrolling 
and navigation will never be hard for them and will always keep them entertained and explore the different cities of Japan.

And when clicking on a city, they will be redirected to a summary of that certain city complete with a 5-day forecast of the weather, and showcases
pictures of places that they can visit additionally, with a zoom functionality.

For the backend mechanics. I have followed and created a simple caching system. This will help optimize the website and make it faster.
The caching systems fetches data from the two API's namely fourquare and OpenWeatherMap and stores them in a temporary JSON file.

This will help prevent slowness and overall satisfy the tourists in using the system since they will minimally or never experience very long loading times.

I hope that the following Weather App reaches or even exceeds your standards.

Again, Thank you very much!
